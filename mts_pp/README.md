This directory contains the tool set for post processing the NeXus file
generated by `mantidtotalscattering`. The main script is a bash script which
could be placed anywhere on analysis cluster and be executed from there. An
input file needs to be provided -- the input file name could be with any name
but it has be located in the `controls` directory that sits parallel to the main
bash script, i.e.,

arbitrary dir

    |- mts_pp

    |- controls
    
        |- control_input.dat

where the name `control_input.dat` can be arbitrary. The routine can then be
executed like this,

```bash
./mts_pp controls/control_input.dat
```

The control file should contain the following entries,

```
INPUT_FILE_DIR      :: output
OUTPUT_DIR          :: SofQ_PDF
WORKSPACE_NAME      :: SQ_banks_normalized
MERGE_INPUT_FILE    :: merge_config.json
PYSTOG_INPUT_FILE   :: pystog_config.json
```

The `INPUT_FILE_DIR` specifies either the NeXus file or a folder to process. If
the entry is a NeXus file, the routine will simply process the single NeXus
file. If it is a directory, the routine will process all the existing NeXus file
under the specified directory. The `OUTPUT_DIR` specifies where all the
processed file will go. The `WORKSPACE_NAME` entry specifies the workspace to
extract from the NeXus file(s). The `MERGE_INPUT_FILE` entry specifies the input
Json file for merging all the banks. The `PYSTOG_INPUT_FILE` entry specifies the
input Json file for pystog.


*N. B.* Both the merge and pystog config Json files should be placed under
the `controls` directory.
